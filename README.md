Fat Free Framework for WordPress


This is a dependency plugin to add fat free framework into the wordpress infrastructure. 

Fat Free Framework is a microframework that is perfect for building secondary systems that need to integrate with wordpress, without using wordpress mechanisms (i.e. custom schemas, custom routes, etc)
